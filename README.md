# Plan

Button to quickly Copy the command

Add tabs + file saving
 - A file is a group of tabs

Add autocomplete when nothing is selected to select an argument

Add command description to highlight

Add settings between search box and cards
 - scroll to top button
 - loading bar display on how many cards
 - adjustable card sizes
 - potentially order and display setting dropdowns


is:e-t-b has a space so it fucks up autocomplete
