# Plan

Button to quickly Copy the command

Jupiter notebook @query syntax to store multiple queries.
 - Expressions before any of the @queries are global and apply to all queries

Add argument information on highlighting over args.

Add history to highlighted to card to enable back button

Ai can add to queries or pull up a query based on name

Ai prompting space can be toggled between query only | ai only | and mix (on mobile mixed is gone)

Add autocomplete when nothing is selected to select an argument

Add command description to highlight

Add linting
 - fields like order can only appear on base level

Add settings between search box and cards
 - scroll to top button
 - loading bar display on how many cards
 - adjustable card sizes
 - potentially order and display setting dropdowns


is:e-t-b has a space so it fucks up autocomplete
