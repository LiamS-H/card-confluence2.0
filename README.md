Autocomplete
    [ ] Add autocomplete when nothing is selected to select an argument

Linting
    [ ] fields like order can only appear on base level
    [ ] certain arguments like t: will only accept from their own

Add settings between search box and cards
    [X] scroll to top button - and scroll to top when a new query is searched
    [X] loading bar display on how many cards
    [ ] adjustable card sizes
    [X] potentially order and display setting dropdowns

Add editor settings
    [ ] Disable tooltips (good for mobile or if you already know everything)

Bugs
    [X] is:e-t-b has a space so it fucks up autocomplete
